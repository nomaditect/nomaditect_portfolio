## Scenario

The aim of this study/project was to perform a detailed analysis on a given car insurance data-set. The main objectives was to excercise the tools that we have learnt as well as python libraries to perform a the analysis.
* Analyse
* EDA + Clean
* Visualize
* Standardize + Normalize
* Run ML Linear Regression
* Conclude findings

## Data
The original limited dataset was provided as part of a bootcamp project.

## Process & Tools

### workflow

Excel: Original file viewing and familiarizing
Jupyter Notebooks: Data cleaning and visualising
EDA: assessment of dataframe to prepare for cleaning
Prepocessing: 3 methods - Normalizer, Dummies and SMOTE
Machine Learning Model: using scikit learn

### libraries + tools

* Dataset: [car_insurance_cleaned_dataset](https://github.com/nomaditect/nomaditect_portfolio/tree/main/highlighted_projects/Car_Insurance_Analysis/Datasets)
* Vizualizations: seaborn / matplotlib
* Code: Jupyter Notebook - Link to code folder
* Visualizations: Python

## Summary

* The model was able to predict a claim amount of +/- 9,314.34 USD @ 77.7% prediction rate
* Upgrade: replace 0 income with a mean variable? # run a forloop replacing 0 with mean.
* Personally i have little to no faith in this model, but hey it was fun!
