## Project Brief

The aim of this study/project was to perform a detailed analysis on a given data-set of car insurance customers. One of the main objectives was to excercise the tools that we have learnt as well as python libraries to perform a 
* 

We are risk analysts employed at a bank. Our team is focusing on credit card services. We are given data from 18.000 of our customers and our boss wants us to work out how we can improve our credit card marketing campaign.

## Scenario

## Challenge: 
Use the given data set to find out what characteristics impact the customers decision on accepting or declining our credit card offer.

## Problem: 
Can we build a machine learning model that predicts if our customer accepts or declines the credit card offer?

# Data

The original data set was provided as part of a bootcamp project.

For further details on all features, please refer to the notebook.

# Process & Tools

## workflow

Excel: Original file viewing and familiarizing
Jupyter Notebooks: Data cleaning and visualising
EDA: assessment of dataframe to prepare for cleaning
Prepocessing: 3 methods - Normalizer, Dummies and SMOTE
Machine Learning Model: using scikit learn

## Tools + Libraries

* Dataset: [car_insurance_cleaned_dataset](https://github.com/nomaditect/nomaditect_portfolio/tree/main/highlighted_projects/Car_Insurance_Analysis/Datasets)
* Vizualizations: seaborn / matplotlib
* Code: Jupyter Notebook - Link to code folder
* Visualizations: Python

## Summary | take aways

* The model was able to predict a claim amount of +/- 9,314.34 USD @ 77.7% prediction rate
* Upgrade: replace 0 income with a mean variable? # run a forloop replacing 0 with mean.
* Personally i have little to no faith in this model, but hey it was fun!
